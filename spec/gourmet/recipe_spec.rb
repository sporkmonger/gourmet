In a heavy saucepan, combine the milk, cream, salt, vanilla bean and 3/4
cup of the sugar and bring to a boil. Stirring well, add the rice. Allow
the mixture to simmer gently, covered, for 1 3/4 hours over a very low
flame, until rice is soft. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Remove
the vanilla bean. Blending well, stir in the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar and
the egg yolk. Allow to cool a bit more. Preheat the broiler. Stir in all
but 2 tablespoons of the whipped cream; pour the mixture into individual
crocks or a souffle dish. (Raisins my be placed in the bottom of the
dishes, if desired.) After spreading the remaining whipped cream in a thin
layer over the top, place the crocks or dish under the broiler until the
pudding is lightly browned. Chill before serving.

lightly floured board, roll in sheet 1/3 inch thick, cut with lightly
floured cutter.  Cook in deep, hot fat (365Â°F).  Drain on crumpled,
absorbent paper.  The doughnuts should rise to the top and begin to brown
