1kg (2.25 lbs) ground beef or mutton (I make it with ground turkey)
2 medium onions, finely chopped
50g butter
30ml curry powder
10ml tumeric
1 clove of garlic, crushed
5 ml green ginger, chopped 
1 green chilli, chopped
30ml brown sugar
2 slices bread
250ml milk
20ml apricot jam
10ml lemon juice
50g seedless raisins
10 dried apricots, chopped
1ml nutmeg
5ml allspice
30g flaked or chopped almonds
salt to taste
6 lemon leaves or 2 bay leaves
3 eggs

Makes 8 servings.

1. Preheat oven to 350F/180C.
2. Saute the onions in the butter till transparent. Add the curry powder,
tumeric, garlic, ginger, chilli and brown sugar. Cook until all liquid has
evaporated, then set aside.
3. Soak the bread in half the milk.
4. Mix the meat, bread, sauteed onion and all the remaining ingredients 
except the eggs, the remaining 125ml nilk and the lemon/bay leaves. 
Season with salt to taste.
5. Spoon into a shallow, greased, casserole dish, smooth the surface and 
press in the lemon or bay leaves.
6. Beat the remaining milk and eggs and pour over the meat. Bake for
apporximately 45 minutes until golden and cooked through.
7. Serve with yellow raisin rice, chutney, dessicated coconut and tomato and
onion sambal. (Tomato and onion sambal is essentially a mixture of finely 
chopped tomato and onion).

That is the full traditional recipe. We normally have it with chutney and 
rice and I like to use a few extra bay leaves. If I can't get fresh ginger, I
substitute a little ground ginger.
