  Recipe by: steelman@execpc.com VLF Vegetarian Recipes  This is a kind of
  very-low-fat vegetarian starter's kit, containing recipes and other
  information (category "text") collected from a variety of computer sources,
  and our own experiences.  The category marked "family approved" are recipes
  we use regularly, that we all like.  The others were collected, but for the
  most part have not been tried.
  
    For a great collection of recipes, we recommend michelle dick's
  www.fatfree.com, and the Usenet newsgroup alt.food.fat-free.
  
   This type of diet was recommended by our cardiologist to help reverse
  Merle's heart disease.  Whether it is working for that is not yet known,
  but we both DO feel healthier eating this way.
   Also, we find the food very satisfying and filling, but low-calorie enough
  to allow for significant weightloss .  And eating this way is getting
  easier all the time.  If you walk SLOWLY through the grocery store each
  week, you will see new "FAT-FREE" food items each week, increasing your
  choices.
