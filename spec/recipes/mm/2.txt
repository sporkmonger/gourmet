  In a heavy saucepan, combine the milk, cream, salt, vanilla bean and 3/4
  cup of the sugar and bring to a boil. Stirring well, add the rice. Allow
  the mixture to simmer gently, covered, for 1 3/4 hours over a very low
  flame, until rice is soft. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Remove
  the vanilla bean. Blending well, stir in the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar and
  the egg yolk. Allow to cool a bit more. Preheat the broiler. Stir in all
  but 2 tablespoons of the whipped cream; pour the mixture into individual
  crocks or a souffle dish. (Raisins my be placed in the bottom of the
  dishes, if desired.) After spreading the remaining whipped cream in a thin
  layer over the top, place the crocks or dish under the broiler until the
  pudding is lightly browned. Chill before serving.
